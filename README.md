# Don't use K8s!!!

**WARNING**: this is a very much work in progress.

While the title doesn't make any sense for now (I'm hoping it will at some point), the content of this repo is intended to be a super easy way to learn and get started with Kubernetes.

That is, if you really need Kubernetes, because many times you might actually not need it or, more common, not being able to afford it.

## STATUS

- [ ] Basic local multi-node cluster for playground with [multipass](https://multipass.run), [k3s](https://k3s.io) and [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup) - in progress

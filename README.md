# Local multi-node K8s playground

Wouldn't be nice to be able to quickly create a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on your local computer (macOS, Linux or Windows) and play with it? That is the purpose of this little project.

Warning: this is very much a work-in-progress.

## STATUS

- [ ] Basic local multi-node cluster for playground with [multipass](https://multipass.run), [k3s](https://k3s.io) and [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup) - in progress
